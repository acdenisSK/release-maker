The input of the tool is json containing all the authors and their respective commits, alongside the url to the repo where the commits are stored.
The resulting output is markdown-formatted text.

The output may start with a header, if provided in the input.
It continues by giving credit to all the authors that have contributed the project.

The commits are split into four classes: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed. Each class is placed under its own heading, and is sorted in that order.
All classes are optional; it's valid to leave one or all classes out of the input.
In each class, their commits are printed out in a list in the order they were written in the input.
Each commit is expressed by their category of function or place, name, author, and its unique hash.

Lastly, hidden text is printed. It provides links to the authors and repo urls to the commit hashes.
