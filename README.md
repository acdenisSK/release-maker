# Release Maker

## What is this?

I am the lead developer of [Serenity], a Rust Discord API wrapper. When publishing new versions we cater our changelogs to a specific style.
I had been writing in this style by hand, but I quickly got sick of it. Hence lead to the creation of this tool that simplifies the process.

## Okay, seems interesting. May I use it?

Sure, do whatever you want with it. There's an example (example.json) file that explains the tool's input. To generate the output, provide a path
to the input file on your storage medium.
